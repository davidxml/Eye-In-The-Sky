# UrbanEye — Eye in the Sky  
An Autonomous Aerial Surveillance System by CXS

## Overview

UrbanEye is the first product from CoXmoS (CXS), designed to revolutionize urban security through real-time aerial intelligence.  
It is an AI-powered drone system that autonomously patrols high-risk areas, detects suspicious or criminal activity using advanced vision models, and instantly alerts law enforcement — all without human intervention.

"Eye in the Sky" — Smart, Silent, and Always Watching.

## Key Features

- AI-Based Crime Detection  
  Detects fights, weapons, suspicious motion, and gatherings using real-time computer vision.

- Thermal & Night Vision  
  Equipped with FLIR sensors to operate silently and effectively in total darkness.

- Instant Response Alerts  
  Sends video proof, coordinates, and timestamps directly to emergency services.

- Autonomous Patrol System  
  Predefined flight paths with live rerouting based on detected activity.

- Silent & Unseen  
  Operates with minimal noise, no sirens or lights — invisible protection from above.

## Tech Stack (Prototype Phase)

- Hardware: Custom drone platform, FLIR thermal camera, GPS  
- AI: Real-time object and behavior detection (YOLOvX with custom-trained models)  
- Navigation: Autonomous route mapping (DroneKit / MAVLink)  
- Backend: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Flask, MQTT  
- Frontend (Dashboard): React.js, Mapbox GL, WebSocket feed

## Why UrbanEye?

Police can’t be everywhere. But our eyes can.

- Crime Prevention — Deter criminal activity before it escalates  
- Faster Response — Shortens time from incident to intervention  
- Objective Evidence — No bias, no error — just verified visual proof  
- Scalable — Designed for cities, private estates, event security, and more
